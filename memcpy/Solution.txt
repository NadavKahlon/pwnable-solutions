The XMM instructions require the address to be aligned to 16 bytes. However, `dest` is allocated each time using malloc, and additional 8 bytes are added - so if we chose a size that's a multiple of 16, the next `dest` will be unaligned, causing the `movntps` opcode to fail. The solution is selecting sizes which are 16*n-8, so that the whole reserved region will be a multiple of 16. Thus nothing breaks and I get the flag.

The issue is that the result of "open(urandom..,...) < 0" is assigned to fd, meaning that fd is now 0 - i.e. stdin. Thus the real password is read from stdin.
So I entered:
1111111111
0000000000
So my password 0000000000 is compared against 1111111111 after XOR-ing its bytes with 1, making them equal.
